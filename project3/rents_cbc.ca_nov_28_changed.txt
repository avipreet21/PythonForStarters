According to a new report this morning from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 
B.C. has some of the  highest rents and lowest vacancy rates in Canada,

The study found that Vancouver, Victoria, Kelowna and Abbotsford-Mission have vacancy rates of less than one per cent.

That means that B.C. is home to four of the five lowest vacancy rates in the country.

The report also found that the average rents in Vancouver increased 
faster than the provincially-capped rate of 3.7 per cent for the third consecutive year, although Kelowna had the 
biggest average rent increase at 8.6 per cent, followed by Victoria at 8.2 per cent and Vancouver at 6.2 per cent.

Vancouver remained the most expensive area to to rent a two-bedroom apartment at an average of $1,552 per month,
with Toronto following at $1,404 per month.

The highest average rental condominium rent was in Toronto at $2,301 per month, followed by Vancouver at $1,874 per month.

In B.C. when a unit turns over to a new tenant, the landlord is free to set a new rent amount at the market level
according to the rent guidelines imposed by the Residential Tenancy Branch.

The report says the supply of purpose-built rental units being approved is increasing, though many won't 
be occupied for years to come. So, it isn't all bad news for renters.
